# Cardiovascular-Disease-Diagnosis-through-Images-in-Logistic-Regression
Implemented a python-based code that detects whether patients have Cardiovascular heart disease or not based on the given dataset with images for 10 years.


- In today's health-care sector, determining the cause of a condition is critical. Early detection of cardiovascular disease can help to avert heart failure and limit the damage to the heart. Weighted voting of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Clustering, Artificial Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network triggered using function methods is used in this paper's proposed model. The suggested model is assessed using a variety of measures, with detailed explanations for each. The proposed model's performance was compared to that of other existing models. Based on the outcomes of the experiments, we can conclude that the suggested approach enhances disease prediction accuracy. Studies can be conducted in the future utilizing various combinations of algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and precision.

- The main objective of this research is to develop a heart prediction system. The system can discover and extract hidden knowledge associated with diseases from a historical heart data set. Heart disease prediction system aims to exploit data mining techniques on medical data set to assist in the prediction of the heart diseases through image analysis.
▪ Predict future diseases of a Patient.
▪ Serve as a Training Tool for medical students.
▪ Used as a tool to initialize diagnosis of cardio – patients by general physicians. ▪ Provides new approach to concealed patterns in the data.
▪ Helps avoid human biasness
▪ Reduce the cost of medical tests.

- Machine learning is commonly utilized in the current healthcare industry to diagnose and forecast disease presence using data models. For studies involving risk assessment of complicated diseases, one of the most commonly utilized machine learning techniques is logistic regression. As a result, the study's goal is to identify the most important cardiovascular disease predictors and estimate total risk using logistic regression and image analysis. The classification goal of this study is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future heart diseases.

1. Data Acquisition
The following data collection is required to implement a diagnosis. Without preceding data, it is impossible to diagnose an illness, and we need data to determine heart rates and other factors about the patient.

2. Data Pre- Processing
Data pre-processing is required in order to develop a more accurate ML model. The process of cleansing data is known as data pre-processing. Missing data, noisy data, and inconsistent data are all examples of this.

3. Train the Set and Test the set of data
The training data is a set of data used to teach a software how to learn and deliver advanced results using technologies such as machine learning. It can be supplemented with additional data sets known as validation and testing sets. A test data set is a separate data set from the training data set that has the same probability distribution as the training data set.

4. Input Data
Here we input the data such as the mentioned below in table 3 to take the values into the logistic regression ML approach which is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. Based on historical data about earlier outcomes involving the same input criteria, it then scores new cases on their probability of falling into a particular outcome category.

5. Probabilities
The probabilities are then counted to evaluate if the function for detecting CVD disease is high or if the data features have a poor detection probability. (0.1 or 0 etc.)

6. Evaluation Values between 0 and 1
The Predicted value will be displayed either as 0 for no disease detected and 1 for CVD disease detected.

Throughout the implementation we used 18 attributes of data and they are:

1. The Medical Image No – The Number which represents the Patients Medical Image Scan of the Heart.
2. Sex – 0 represents the Male, 1 represents the Female.
3. Age – Age of the Patient.
4. Current Smoker – 0 represents the patient is not a smoker, 1 represents the patients is a smoker.
5. Cigs Per Day – The Number of Cigarettes consumed by the Patient.
6. BP Meds - 0 represents the patient does not take Blood Pressure Medicine, 1 represents the
patients takes Blood Pressure Medicines.
7. Prevalent Stroke - 0 represents the patient haven’t had a prev Stroke before,1 represents the
patient had a prev Stroke before.
8. Prevalent Hyp - 0 represents the patient haven’t had a prev hypertension before,1 represents the patient had a prev hypertension before.
9. Diabetes - 0 represents the patient doesn’t have diabetes, 1 represents the patients have diabetes.
10. Fam Check Up – represents the patient has not done a Family Checkup, 1 represents the patient
has done a family checkup.
11. Total Cholesterol – The total number of Cholesterol the Patient has.
12. Troponin Level – The total level of Troponin the Patient has.
13. Rest ECG – This detects whether the patients has done a ECG or not.
14. Systolic BP – The level of SysBP in the Patient.
15. Diastolic BP – The level of in the Patient.
16. Body Mass Index – The number of Body Mass Index of the patient.
17. Heart Rate – The Rate of the Patients Heart.
18. Ten Year CVD Target – The detections based on 1 and 0 (0 represents the patients who do not have the ten-year risk of CVD and 1 represents the patients who have a risk of ten-year CVD disease.)
